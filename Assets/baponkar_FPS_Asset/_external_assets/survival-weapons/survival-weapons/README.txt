-- INSTRUCTIONS --

If you are using Unity and want to get up an running right away you can open the "Survival Weapons.unitypackage" which also comes with an Example Scene.

If not look under the "Models" folder.

The "Models" folder contains the models in .fbx format along with all of the textures.

Make sure to import the "Textures" folder together with the model you choose.

If you want to use the 2K textures look under the "2K Textures" folder instead.
