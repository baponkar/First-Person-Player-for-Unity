## Doc :
This is complete Unity Project if You download this project and open it then it will works perfectly.
If you use this project with your old project then first put 'Asset' folder in your project.
Create two Layers 1. Draw Alaways 2. Mini map and then Change the layers of 'DrawAlawaysCam' and 'Arms05(including childrens of it)' Which will help to see the player hand by Draw AlawaysCam Camera.
Change the layers of Minimap (including Childrens of it) otherwise Minimap would not works perfectly.
